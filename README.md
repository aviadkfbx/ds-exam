# Data Science Programming Questions

## How to play
1. Fork the repo
2. Clone the fork locally.
3. Implement, push, test, repeat.
4. Create a Pull Request once you are done.

## Tasks:
### 1. Sequence Question
Read the instructions in `sequence_question.py` on how to find the special value within an arbitrary sequence. Only implement the `find_most_frequent` method.
You can check your results in the `sequence_question_test.py`.

### 2. Vector implementation
In `vector.py` you will find you have an abstract class of `Vector` with 2 concrete implementations: `DenseVector` and `SparseVector`.
Implement all methods. Add tests as you see fit.

Bonus: implement the `BinaryVector` class too.
